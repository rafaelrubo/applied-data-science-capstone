Introduction


The Brazilian immigration wave to the US hit its peak in the 1990s and early 2000s.
During the 17 years between 1990 and 2007 over 275,000 Brazilians migrated to the United States.
In total, around 7% of the entire US Brazilian population lives in New York City.

According to the United States Census Bureau, in a survey from 2012, there were 72,635 brazilians living in NYC.
It is the main metropolitan area of brazilian population, followed by Boston (63,930) and Miami (43,930).

So, where exactly do Brazilians hang out in the city?
Where can you find feijoada (a stew of beans with beef and pork) and other delicious Brazilian foods?

This project will attempt to answer the questions “Where should an investor open a Brazilian Restaurant in NYC?”
and “Where should I go If I want great Brazilian food?”
